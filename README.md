## Core Features

- **üìù Rich Journaling:** Create entries with titles, multi-line text, and multiple photos.
- **üß† AI-Powered Analysis:** Each entry is automatically analyzed by Google's Gemini AI to provide:
    - **Sentiment:** Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Reflective mood analysis.
    - **Key Themes:** Identification of core topics like "Work," "Personal Growth," etc.
    - **Summaries & Advice:** Concise summaries and compassionate, actionable advice.
- **üìä Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize your mood over time with a beautiful, filterable chart and see key statistics about your journaling habits.
- **üîí Privacy First:**
    - All data is stored locally and securely on your device using **Hive**.
    - **Biometric App Lock** (Fingerprint/Face ID) protects your journal from unauthorized access.
    - **Lifecycle-Aware Lock:** The app automatically re-locks after being in the background for a set duration.
- **üé® Personalization:**
    - Create a user profile with a custom name and profile picture.
    - Choose from multiple **app accent colors** to make the app your own.
- **‚ú® Adaptive & Modern UI:**
    - A stunning, dark-mode UI inspired by professional designs.
    - **Adaptive Layout:** The interface intelligently switches from a bottom navigation bar to a side navigation rail on tablets or in landscape mode.
- **üîé Powerful Search:** A dedicated screen to search and filter all entries by keyword, date range, mood, and AI-generated themes.
- **üöÄ Smooth Onboarding:** A polished, multi-step onboarding flow for first-time users.

## Technology Stack

| Component          | Technology / Package                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Framework**      | `Flutter 3.x.x`                                               |
| **State Management** | `provider` for global state (like theming)                 |
| **Local Database** | `hive` / `hive_flutter` for fast, on-device NoSQL storage      |
| **Generative AI**  | `google_generative_ai` (for Google Gemini API)            |
| **UI & Charting**  | `table_calendar`, `fl_chart`, `image_picker`                    |
| **Security**       | `local_auth` for biometrics, `shared_preferences` for flags    |

## Architecture & Professional Patterns

This project wasn't just built; it was architected. Key professional patterns include:

- **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Logic for AI, security, and theming is decoupled into dedicated "services," keeping UI code clean and maintainable.
- **Adaptive UI:** `LayoutBuilder` is used to create a responsive experience for various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Global State Management:** `Provider` is used for app-wide state (like the current theme), ensuring the UI reacts instantly to changes.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** All database and network calls are handled asynchronously using `Future` and `async/await` to ensure a smooth, non-blocking UI.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Helper methods are used extensively to break down complex UI into readable components. All sensitive keys are stored in a `.gitignore`'d `secrets.dart` file.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- You must have the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- An IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mindmeld_ai.git


Navigate into the project directory

Generated sh
cd mindmeld_ai
Sh

Install dependencies

Generated sh
flutter pub get

Crucial: Create your AI API key file.

In the lib/ directory, create a new file named secrets.dart.

Add the following content, pasting in your API key from Google AI Studio:

const String geminiApiKey = 'PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE';

Run the code generator for the Hive database models:

Generated sh
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Run the app on an emulator or a physical device:

Generated sh
flutter run

Future Roadmap

This project has a strong foundation, but there are many exciting paths forward:

Habit & Goal Tracking: Integrate tools to set and track personal goals.

Secure Cloud Sync: Implement end-to-end encrypted backup and sync using Firebase.

AI-Powered Notifications: Proactively send users a weekly summary of their mood trends.

Rich Text Editing: Add markdown support (bold, italics, lists) to the journal editor.
